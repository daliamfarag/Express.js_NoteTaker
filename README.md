2. Click the red delete button in the list to delete the corresponding note from the list.
3. Click the new entry button on top right corner to open a text area to create new note.

# How to Use

:crystal_ball: This application is really intuitive and easy to use, once the user enters a title and some text body, a `save` button will pop on the top right corner so the user can save this note. Once saved, that note is displayed on the left.

:eyes: User can delete unwanted note by just clicking on the red icon. If user wants to view the text body, he/she can simply click on the note and contents will be displayed.

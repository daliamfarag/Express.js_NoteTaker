# Description

This project builds a web application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

There are three main features of this application:

1. When both title and text are entered, click the save icon to save the note to list.
2. Click the red delete button in the list to delete the corresponding note from the list.
3. Click the new entry button on top right corner to open a text area to create new note.


# How to Use

This application is really intuitive and easy to use, once the user enters a title and some text body, a `save` button will pop on the top right corner so the user can save this note. Once saved, that note is displayed on the left.

User can delete unwanted note by just clicking on the red icon. If user wants to view the text body, they can simply click on the note and contents will be displayed.
